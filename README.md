This software enables to extract and visualize regularities (i.e., patterns) from a set of two-dimensional annotated arrays. 

An annotated array is a two-dimensional data structure in which the order of the line is important (it usually represents the temporality) whereas the order of the columns is irrelevant.

For instance, the data produced by a smartphone could be represented as an annotated array :
- each column corresponds to one sensor (so the columns order is irrelevant) ;
- each line corresponds to the mean value of each sensor during a given amount of time (the lines are ordered chronologically).
